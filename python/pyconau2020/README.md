# Rube Codeberg entry

Made as an entry for the 'Rube Codeberg' competition conducted as part of the
11th PyCon Australia ([PyConline AU 2020](https://2020.pycon.org.au/program/sun/#rube-codeberg-competition).

The name of the contest is named after [Rube Goldberg machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine), which are in turn named after the American cartoonist [Rube Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg).

## Objective
The aim of the contest was to make a 'hello world' program in Python in as complicated
a way as possible.


## Cool entries
There were lot of cool entries for the competition (but I forgot which among them were the winning entries).

I couldn't dig all of them up but did manage to find this one:
